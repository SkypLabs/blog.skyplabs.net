Self-educated since my childhood, I am a technology and science lover with a deep passion for IT and open-source software, and obsessed by automation.

Involved in many projects, professional or not, I like to express my creativity in various ways and exchange knowledge and experience with people.


This blog allows me to share my ideas, work and various knowledge.
