Hello,

My name is Paul aka Skyper.

Self-educated since my childhood, I am a technology and science lover with a deep passion for IT, InfoSec and open-source software and obsessed by automation.

Involved in many projects, professional or not, I like to express my creativity in various ways and exchange knowledge and experience with people.

This blog allows me to share my ideas, work and various knowledge. I hope you will enjoy it :)
