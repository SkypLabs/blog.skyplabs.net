I've been working on many open-source software and other publicly-shared resources for a long while now without asking any counterpart as I love what I'm doing and I deeply think that good engineering is a matter of sharing and exchanging with people. Also, security and privacy go hand-in-hand with transparency and we definitely need more of it in our actual world.

Having said that, if you like my work and want to support me, tips are very welcome ðŸ™‚
